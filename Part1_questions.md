Questions
1.	Is there a noticeable difference in the performance of the two algorithms? Which is faster, and by how much? Does this surprise you?
yes, Dynamic is slightly faster than Exhaustive Optimization.Since both have time of n^2, but in the time unit calculations"
Dynamic:(11n^2 + 11n)/2 and Exhaustive:  (15n^2 + 15n)/2 after plotting points we found that Dynamic is more efficient than Exhaustive. Yes, because i thought Dynamic is way faster and plus i thought Exhaustive would be only 2^n, but in our case is n^2 

2.	Are your empirical analyses consistent with your mathematical analyses? Justify your answer.
yes, Dynamic:(11n^2 + 11n)/2 and Exhaustive:  (15n^2 + 15n)/2. After plotting points from 1-10, we get max point in exhaustive 825 and in Dynamic is 605  

3.	Is this evidence consistent or inconsistent with hypothesis 1? Justify your answer.
conssistent because both Dynamic and Exhaustive and thier time complexity is n^2, so both are efficient, but Dynamic is slightly efficient than Exhaustive because of the difference of calculation:
Dynamic:(11n^2 + 11n)/2 and Exhaustive:  (15n^2 + 15n)/2. After plotting points from 1-10, we get max point in exhaustive 825 and in Dynamic is 605  
4.	Is this evidence consistent or inconsistent with hypothesis 2? Justify your answer.
inconsistent because for Dynamic is impossible to be inefficient due to the fact that n^2 has slower growth than 2^n and also if we test both equations we can see that Dynamic has slower growth than Exhaustive:
Dynamic:(11n^2 + 11n)/2 and Exhaustive:  (15n^2 + 15n)/2. After plotting points from 1-10, we get max point in exhaustive 825 and in Dynamic is 605
